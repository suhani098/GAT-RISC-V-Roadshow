TASK-1 : To look into the C based lab videos and Risc-v based lab videos and check how the c-code will compile in gcc and riscv gcc :

The code is first typed in leafpad editor 


the c-code is run in risc-v compiler using -O1 optimization flag
it is seen here at the main block the number of instruction set is 15 

next in similar way we will run the c-code in risc-v compiler using -Ofast optimization flag
it can be seen that the number of instruction from has reduced to 12 instruction set , we can say that the processing speed increases
