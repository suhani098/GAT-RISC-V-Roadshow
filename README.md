TASK-1 : To look into the C based lab videos and Risc-v based lab videos and check how the c-code will compile in gcc and riscv gcc envirorment

The code run using gcc compiler

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd9308c5-b005-424e-8fea-89f2eb20ddfc)
the c-code is run in risc-v compiler using -O1 optimization flag

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d2a25a3-c96d-4fb7-bcac-e815439a5d0a)
it is seen here at the main block the number of instruction set is 15 

next in similar way we will run the c-code in risc-v compiler using -Ofast optimization flag

it can be seen that the number of instruction from has reduced to 12 instruction set , we can say that the processing speed increases
